# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Package version: Latest available from npm registry

### 2. Modified Files

#### app/layout.tsx
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`
- This follows the best practice for App Router projects

#### package.json
- Added `@vercel/analytics` to dependencies

#### package-lock.json
- Updated with new dependency tree for @vercel/analytics

## Implementation Details:

- **Router Type**: App Router (detected from `/app` directory structure)
- **Package Manager**: npm (detected from `package-lock.json` presence)
- **Component Placement**: Root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`) inside the `<body>` tag
- **Build Status**: ✅ Build completed successfully
- **Linter Status**: ✅ No linting errors
- **Tests**: No test suite configured in the project

## Verification Steps Completed:

1. ✅ Package installed successfully (366 packages added)
2. ✅ Analytics component imported and added to layout
3. ✅ Linter passed with no errors
4. ✅ Build completed successfully (23/23 pages generated)
5. ✅ All changes preserved existing code structure

## Notes:

The Analytics component will automatically track page views and other web vitals when deployed to Vercel. No additional configuration is required. The component is designed to only send data in production environments.
