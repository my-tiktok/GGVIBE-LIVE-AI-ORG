## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for Next.js.

### Changes Made

**1. Installed @vercel/speed-insights package**
   - Added @vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1 to dependencies
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json

**2. Modified app/layout.tsx**
   - Imported SpeedInsights from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
   - Added <SpeedInsights /> component inside the <body> tag after {children} and <Analytics />

### Implementation Details

Since this project uses Next.js 15.5.12 (well above 13.5+) with App Router, I followed the recommended approach:
- Used the '@vercel/speed-insights/next' import (App Router optimized)
- Placed the component in the root layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Positioned it after existing Analytics component for consistency

The SpeedInsights component will now automatically track Core Web Vitals and performance metrics for the application.

### Verification

✅ Dependencies installed successfully
✅ Linter ran with no new errors (only pre-existing warnings)
✅ Code follows existing patterns and structure
✅ Lock file (package-lock.json) updated

### Files Modified
- app/layout.tsx
- package.json
- package-lock.json

### Notes
- The project had pre-existing build errors related to missing environment validation modules (@/lib/env/validate), which are unrelated to our changes
- The implementation follows the exact pattern already used for @vercel/analytics in the same layout file
- Speed Insights will begin tracking metrics once deployed to Vercel
